# Sorting Program in Assembly Language

## Overview

This sorting program was developed as a project for the Computer Organization and Assembly Language course at FAST NUCES, Karachi. It allows sorting of strings, characters, and integers using different algorithms tailored to each data type.

## Features

- **Sorting Types Supported:**
  - Integer Sort (Bubble Sort)
  - Character Sort (Bubble Sort)
  - String and Sentence Sort

- **Libraries Used:**
  - Irvine Library for assembly language programming in Visual Studio 2019.

## How to Use

1. **Installation:**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Setup:**
   - Ensure Visual Studio 2019 is installed with Irvine Library configured.

3. **Execution:**
   - Open the project in Visual Studio.
   - Build and run the project.

4. **Usage:**
   - Follow the on-screen prompts to select the type of sorting.
   - Enter the number of inputs and the elements to be sorted.

5. **Output:**
   - The program will display the sorted results based on your input.

## Methodology

The program uses bubble sort algorithms for sorting integers and characters, and a custom method for sorting strings and sentences based on spaces and ASCII values. Each sorting type has a dedicated function to ensure accuracy and efficiency.

## Future Improvements

- Allow users to choose different sorting algorithms.
- Enhance user interface with more interactive features.
- Expand sorting capabilities to handle additional data types or complex scenarios.
